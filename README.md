# AstanleyCLIProject

This Ruby Gem uses a CLI to give a user access to all of the teams that are in the National Hockey League (NHL). The user can select a team, and will be given a list of statistical categories to choose from. Once a category is chosen, the statistics will be displayed and the user can enter another statistic, team, or exit.

```ruby
gem 'astanley_CLI_project'
